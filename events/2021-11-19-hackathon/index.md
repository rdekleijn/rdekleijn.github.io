## What is this about?
Fundamentally, this hackathon is about human and artificial intelligence. Human intelligence is commonly measured by means of an IQ-test, quantifying the intellectual capabilities of a person in different domains such as analogical reasoning, vocabulary, and common knowledge. 

In this hackathon, all teams will create a computer program that can solve non-verbal IQ-test items similar to [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices). At the start of the event, we will provide you with 10 training items (puzzles and the correct answer in PNG format). At the end, we will test each team's solution on 10 unseen test items. **The team that can solve most puzzles will win the hackathon.**

## Approximate schedule
1. 17:00–17:30 Welcome
2. 17:30–19:00 Publication of training items and programming
3. 19:00–19:45 Pizza dinner
4. 19:45–23:00 Programming
5. 23:00–00:00 Testing of solutions and high-fiving the winning team

## Who are eligible to participate?
Participation is open to all members of the Leiden academic community, from BA/BSc students to professors. We encourage mixed-seniority teams and interdisciplinary teams to apply.


## Technical details
### What is the deliverable?
You will create a computer program that can solve [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices)-like puzzles. 2x2 puzzles will be provided as 3 PNG files, with 6 PNG files as possible answers. 3x3 puzzles will be provided as 8 PNG files, with 8 PNG files as possible answers. Given the input files, your program should output the file name of the correct answer.

### What language should I use?
You can use your language of choice. However, we encourage you to make sure you have all necessary libraries to read PNG files (e.g. Pillow for Python, javax.imageio for Java).
