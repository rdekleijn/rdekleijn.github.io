## What is this about?
Fundamentally, this hackathon is about human and artificial intelligence. Human intelligence is commonly measured by means of an IQ-test, quantifying the intellectual capabilities of a person in different domains such as analogical reasoning, vocabulary, and common knowledge. 

In this hackathon, all teams will create a computer program that can solve non-verbal IQ-test items similar to [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices). At the start of the event, we will provide you with 10 training items (puzzles and the correct answer). At the end, we will test each team's solution on 10 unseen test items. The team that can solve most puzzles will win the hackathon.

## Approximate schedule
1. 17:00–17:30 Welcome
2. 17:30–19:00 Publication of training items and programming
3. 19:00–19:45 Pizza dinner
4. 19:45–23:00 Programming
5. 23:00–00:00 Testing of solutions and high-fiving the winning team

## Who are eligible to participate?
Participation is open to all members of the Leiden academic community, from BA/BSc students to professors. In fact, we encourage mixed-seniority teams and interdisciplinary teams to apply.
