## What is this about?
Fundamentally, this is about human and artificial intelligence. Human intelligence is commonly measured by means of an IQ-test, quantifying the intellectual capabilities of a person in different domains such as analogical reasoning, vocabulary, and common knowledge. 



## Who are eligible to participate?
Participation is open to all members of the Leiden academic community, from BA/BSc students to professors. In fact, we encourage mixed-seniority teams and interdisciplinary teams to apply.
