- Date and time: Friday, 19 November 2021 from 17:00 to 00:00

## What is this about?
Fundamentally, this hackathon is about human and artificial intelligence. Human intelligence is commonly measured by means of an IQ-test, quantifying the intellectual capabilities of a person in different domains such as analogical reasoning, vocabulary, and common knowledge. 

In this hackathon, each team will create a computer program that can solve non-verbal IQ-test items similar to [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices). At the start of the event, we will provide you with 10 training items (puzzles and the correct answer in PNG format). At the end, we will test each team's solution on 10 unseen test items. **The team that can solve most puzzles will win the hackathon.**

## Approximate schedule
1. 17:00–17:30 Welcome
2. 17:30–19:00 Release of training items and programming
3. 19:00–19:45 Pizza dinner
4. 19:45–23:00 Programming
5. 23:00–00:00 Testing of solutions with test items and high-fiving the winning team

Food in the form of pizza (also vegetarian) and snacks will be provided. Drinks in the form of beer and soft drinks (also water) will be provided. 

> Note that the event ends at midnight. It may be a good idea to check your return trip home and/or get an OV-fiets.

## Who are eligible to participate?
Participation is open to all members of the Leiden academic community, from BA/BSc students to professors. We encourage mixed-seniority teams and interdisciplinary teams to apply.

## Will a computer be provided?
No, you are expected to bring your own device.


## Technical details

Note that details below may change. If so, this information will be provided at the start of the event.

### What is the deliverable?
You will create a computer program that can solve [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices)-like puzzles. 2x2 puzzles will be provided as 3 PNG files, with 6 PNG files as possible answers. 3x3 puzzles will be provided as 8 PNG files, with 8 PNG files as possible answers. Given the input files, your program should print the file name of the correct answer to console (or stdout).

### What language should I use?
You can use your language of choice. However, we encourage you to make sure beforehand you have all necessary libraries to read PNG files (e.g. Pillow for Python, javax.imageio for Java, OpenCV with appropriate bindings).
