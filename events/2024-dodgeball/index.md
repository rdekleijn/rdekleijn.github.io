## What is this about?
Fundamentally, this hackathon is about human and artificial intelligence. Human intelligence is commonly measured by means of an IQ test, quantifying the intellectual capabilities of a person in different domains such as analogical reasoning, vocabulary, processing speed, and general knowledge. Let's see how far we get in getting a computer to show some of the same capabilities.

In this hackathon, each team will create a computer program that can solve non-verbal IQ test items similar to [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices). At the start of the event, we will provide you with 10 training items (puzzles and the correct answer in PNG format). At the end, we will test each team's solution on 20 unseen test items. **The team that can solve most puzzles will win the hackathon.** 

Don't worry, there won't be any naming and shaming of the worst-performing teams. This is an unsolved problem and an active field of research, so we do not expect any teams to get a perfect score (although that would be a great paper).

## Approximate schedule
1. 15:00–17:30 Dodgeball tournament

> Note that the event ends at midnight. It may be a good idea to check your return trip home and/or get an OV-fiets.

## Questions that you might have

### Why dodgeball and not volleyball or soccer or [insert sport]?
Whereas volleyball or soccer require specific practice before actually being able to meaningfully contribute to your team, dodgeball is a very low-threshold sport that only requires basic hand-eye coordination and the ability to throw a ball. This makes it a perfect sport for everyone to contribute.

### Isn’t dodgeball injury-prone?
No. We will use soft, 22 cm foam balls that do not hurt when being hit and can do no damage with normal play.
