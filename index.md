## Background
I have an M.Sc. in Computer Science (with specialization in Machine Learning) from [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/) and an M.Sc. in Cognitive Neuroscience from [Leiden University](http://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), graduating on my thesis *Computational modeling of individual differences using stochastic information accumulation models,* supervised by [Jay McClelland](http://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/) at [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from [Leiden University](http://www.universiteitleiden.nl/) under the supervision of [Bernhard Hommel](http://www.bernhard-hommel.eu/), for my dissertation *Control of complex actions in humans and robots.*

## Current [work](http://roydekleijn.nl/my-work/)
I work as an [assistant professor](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/roy-de-kleijn) at [Leiden University](http://www.universiteitleiden.nl/) and the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I lecture in the Psychology and the Computer Science curricula on topics ranging from general psychology to topics in my area of expertise such as artificial intelligence, computational modeling, and artificial neural networks. My Ph.D. research, supervised by [Bernhard Hommel](http://www.bernhard-hommel.eu/) and [George Kachergis](http://kachergis.com/), focused on developing computational models of cognition for use in robotic systems as part of the EU-funded research project *[RoboHow.Cog](http://robohow.org/): Web-enabled and experience-based cognitive robots that learn complex everyday manipulation tasks.*

My current research is focused on how artificial robotic agents can solve complex problems using biologically inspired techniques, specifically sequential and goal-driven action learning through (deep) reinforcement learning and evolutionary robotics.

I am involved in teaching or coordinating the following courses:

- Artificial Intelligence and Neurocognition
- Introduction to Psychology *[Inleiding in de Psychologie]*
- Introduction to Cognitive Science
- Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making: Neural and Computational Mechanisms
- Cognitive Psychology *[Cognitieve Psychologie]*
- Cognitive Robotics
