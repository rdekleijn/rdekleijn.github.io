## What is this about?
For frequentist hypothesis testing, several power calculators (e.g. G\*Power[^1], powerandsamplesize.com[^2]) are available to determine the minimum sample size needed to detect an effect with a given probability (statistical power). No such calculators are available (to my knowledge) for the Bayesian versions of t-tests, ANOVA, and linear correlations returning a Bayes factor[^3]. Calculating statistical power for these techniques for given sample sizes is done using simulation, and to save everyone a lot of time I will summarize my findings below.
